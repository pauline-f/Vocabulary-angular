# Vocabulary-angular

This application's goal is to help learning vocabulary in another language. 
The user can add words in a list. For each word, there is a translation.
The user can display all the words or words from a specific list.
Later, the user will be able to do a quizz. The program will display a word and the user will write the translation. It will be also possible to do the opposite (a translation is displayed, and the user writes the word).

Features available: 
- Display all the words
- Display the words of a specific list
- Add word in a list or a new list
- Remove word
