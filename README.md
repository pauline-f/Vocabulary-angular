# Vocabulary-angular

DEMO: https://vocabulary-cd6bb.firebaseapp.com/

This application's goal is to help learning vocabulary in another language. 
First, the user creates a login and chooses his language and the language he wants to learn.
The user can add words in a list. For each word, there is a translation.
When the user adds a word, the translation appears. The user can change the translation if he wants.
The user can display all the words or words from a specific list and play a quizz. 
For the quizz, the program displays a word or the translation or reads text as audio, and the user writes the answer.
